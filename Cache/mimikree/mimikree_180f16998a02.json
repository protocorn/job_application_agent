    "The job description mentions experience with computer vision. Have you worked on any projects involving computer vision, and if so, could you elaborate on the techniques and tools you used?": "Hey there! While my resume doesn't explicitly highlight computer vision projects, some of the work I've done touches on related concepts. For instance, in the \"Automatic Infographic Generation for Medical Papers\" project, I worked on extracting figures, titles, and captions from medical papers. This involved a heuristic-driven extraction system that achieved 90% accuracy in identifying these elements. Although it wasn't a traditional computer vision task, it did require analyzing the structure and content of images within the papers. Also, while building the Mimikree project I worked on ingesting images and generating captions for them as well.\n\nI'm eager to learn more about computer vision, and I believe my skills in Python, deep learning, and image analysis would allow me to quickly adapt to computer vision tasks. I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my skill set!",
    "Have you used data engineering tools such as Spark or Pandas for data analysis and preparation, particularly in the context of machine learning projects?": "Hey there! Yeah, absolutely. I've used both Spark and Pandas quite a bit for data analysis and prep, especially in my machine learning projects. Pandas is my go-to for smaller datasets because it's super easy to use and has great tools for cleaning and exploring data. For larger datasets, Spark is a lifesaver. I've used it with PySpark to handle big data efficiently, which is crucial when you're training complex models.\n\nWhat tools are you currently working with?",
    "Can you provide examples of how you have applied MLOps concepts in your projects, such as model monitoring, versioning, or automated deployment pipelines?": "That's a great question! While I'm still a student and many of my projects are for academic purposes, I've definitely explored MLOps concepts in a few of them. Here are a couple of examples:\n\n*   **Model Versioning:** In one of my NLP projects focused on sentiment analysis, I experimented with different model architectures (like comparing ML vs. DL models, as mentioned in my LinkedIn summary). I used Git to track the different versions of the models, along with their associated training data and evaluation metrics. This helped me understand which changes led to improvements in performance and keep a record of the best-performing models.\n\n*   **Automated Deployment Pipelines:** For a personal project involving a web app that uses machine learning for image captioning, I looked into using Docker and CI/CD pipelines (although I haven't fully implemented it yet). The idea was to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying new versions of the model whenever I made changes to the code or the model itself. I was planning to use tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to achieve this.\n\n*   **Model Monitoring:** While I haven't set up extensive real-time monitoring, I always make sure to log key metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall during the training and evaluation phases. I also look at things like confusion matrices to get a better understanding of where the model might be struggling. For a deployed model, I would consider monitoring the model's performance over time using tools like Prometheus or Grafana to detect any degradation in performance.\n\nI'm eager to learn more about MLOps and implement these practices more rigorously in my future projects and internships!",
    "The job description emphasizes the importance of data analysis and cleaning. Could you share a specific instance where you had to address a significant data quality issue and how you resolved it?": "Hey there! Absolutely, I can share an experience where I tackled a significant data quality issue. During my project on Automatic Infographic Generation for Medical Papers, we encountered a lot of inconsistencies in the medical paper data. Specifically, the section segmentation (Abstract, Results, Conclusion) was pretty messed up, with inconsistent formatting and missing labels.\n\nTo fix this, we first cleaned the text data by removing special characters and standardizing the formatting. Then, I trained an LSTM model to accurately segment these sections. The key was creating a heuristic-driven extraction system to identify figures, titles, and captions with high accuracy (around 90%). This significantly improved the data quality, boosting our overall accuracy in segmenting the sections to 82%.\n\nThis experience taught me the importance of meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure reliable and accurate results. It also highlighted how crucial it is to validate and verify data to make sure it aligns with the project's objectives!",
    "Have you had any experience integrating AI models into production environments using APIs, and if so, could you describe the challenges you faced and how you overcame them?": "Yeah, definitely! In my Mimikree project, I integrated the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to generate personalized responses based on user data. One of the challenges I faced was dealing with rate limits. To overcome this, I implemented an API key rotation system that automatically switches to the next available key when one reaches its limit. This ensures continuous operation and maximizes throughput. I also optimized the backend using serverless functions to reduce query latency by 40%. This involved some tricky custom embedding optimizations to make things run smoothly and quickly!",
    "Are you familiar with responsible AI principles, and have you applied them in any of your projects to address potential biases or ethical considerations?": "Hey there! As Sahil Chordia, I'm definitely familiar with responsible AI principles. It's a super important topic. In the context of Mimikree, I've tried to address ethical considerations by prioritizing user privacy. For example, when integrating Google Calendar, the AI only retrieves event timings and doesn't disclose any event details to other users. Also, the system is designed to give users control over the data they input, so they have a say in what their AI model learns. I'm always looking for ways to improve and refine these aspects!",
    "While you mention AWS, could you elaborate on specific AWS services you have used in the context of AI/ML, such as SageMaker, Lambda, or S3?": "Hey there! Thanks for the question. Actually, I haven't used AWS services like SageMaker, Lambda, or S3 in the context of Mimikree. My focus has been primarily on leveraging Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash API, along with other tools like Pinecone for vector storage and Cloudinary for image hosting. While I'm familiar with AWS in general, my direct experience in AI/ML has been more aligned with the technologies I mentioned earlier. Hope that clears things up!",
    "Can you provide an example of a time you visualized data and model outputs for a non-technical audience, and how you tailored your communication to their level of understanding?": "That's a great question! While Mimikree itself focuses on making AI accessible, I can definitely share an experience from my own projects where I visualized data for a non-technical audience. \n\nDuring my time at UMD, I worked on a project involving predicting student performance based on various factors. The model outputs were, of course, full of probabilities and technical jargon. But when presenting to the university board (who weren't data scientists!), I knew a different approach was needed.\n\nInstead of diving into the model's intricacies, I focused on creating simple, intuitive visualizations. I used bar charts to show the correlation between factors like attendance and grades, and I presented the predicted performance as easily understandable categories like \"High Risk,\" \"Medium Risk,\" and \"Low Risk.\"\n\nThe key was to translate the complex data into actionable insights. I avoided technical terms, focused on the 'so what?' of the data, and used real-world examples to illustrate the findings. This helped them grasp the project's implications for student support and resource allocation without getting lost in the technical details. Does that make sense?",
    "The job description mentions Agile development cycles. Can you describe your experience working in an Agile environment and how you contributed to iterative product improvement?": "That's a great question! While I haven't worked in a formal Agile team in a company setting yet, I've definitely embraced the Agile philosophy in my personal projects and research. \n\nFor example, with my \"Automatic Infographic Generation for Medical Papers\" project, we started with a basic prototype that could extract text from medical papers. Then, in short iterative cycles, we added features like abstractive summarization using LLMs, section segmentation with LSTMs, and heuristic-driven figure extraction.  We were constantly evaluating our progress, getting feedback from our collaborators at Data Science and Wizards Pvt Ltd, and adjusting our approach. This helped us quickly adapt to challenges and ultimately achieve a 64% reduction in medical paper reading time.\n\nSimilarly, in my solo projects like Mimikree and Smart Gmail Assistant, I break down the development into smaller, manageable tasks, focusing on delivering a functional feature in each iteration.  I'm a big believer in the \"fail fast, learn faster\" principle, so I prioritize building and testing early and often.",
    "The role emphasizes using AI to enhance decision-making and business processes. Do you have examples of projects where your AI solutions directly improved decision-making or streamlined business operations? Can you quantify the impact?": "Absolutely! My projects have focused on directly improving decision-making and streamlining operations through AI. Here's a couple of examples:\n\n*   **Mimikree - Personalized AI Assistant:** This web-based AI assistant ingests diverse user content and generates personalized LLMs. A key feature was optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance. By engineering a hybrid retrieval strategy—70% expanded query and 30% current query context—I achieved a **40% reduction in query latency**.\n\n*   **Smart Gmail Assistant:** I developed a Chrome extension that provides advanced email summarization and context-aware responses using Google APIs. By incorporating a caching mechanism for API calls, I significantly reduced API latency, optimizing the extension's performance. This made the whole email handling process much more efficient.\n\n*   **Automatic Infographic Generation for Medical Papers:** As the lead of a research team, I developed an AI-powered system that automatically generated infographics from medical papers. By utilizing LLMs and graph-based models, we **reduced medical paper reading time by 64%**, making it easier for medical professionals to quickly grasp key information."
