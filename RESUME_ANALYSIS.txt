PDF TO GOOGLE DOC CONVERSION - IMPLEMENTED
===========================================

PROBLEM:
--------
- Users were unable to preview PDF files uploaded via the file upload feature
- The error was: "Failed to launch 'uploaded:filename.pdf' because the scheme does not have a registered handler"
- The uploaded PDF was stored with a fake URL "uploaded:filename" which couldn't be previewed

SOLUTION:
---------
PDFs and DOCX files are now automatically uploaded to Google Drive and converted to Google Docs format.

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. BACKEND (server/api_server.py):
   - Modified the `/api/upload-resume` endpoint to:
     * Require Google OAuth connection (users must connect Google account first)
     * Upload the PDF/DOCX file to user's Google Drive
     * Automatically convert to Google Docs format using Drive API
     * Extract text from the Google Doc (not the original PDF)
     * Process with LLM and return the Google Doc URL
     * Store the Google Doc URL in the user's profile

2. FRONTEND (Website/job-agent-frontend/src/Profile.js):
   - Updated the `processResumeFile` function to:
     * Use the Google Doc URL returned from backend (instead of "uploaded:filename")
     * Update resumeUrl state for preview
     * Show preview of the Google Doc automatically
     * Handle errors when Google account is not connected
   
   - Updated UI to:
     * Disable upload button if Google account is not connected
     * Show warning message requiring Google account connection
     * Change button text to "Upload & Convert to Google Doc"
     * Display helpful info about the conversion process

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
-----------------
1. User connects their Google account (required)
2. User selects a PDF or DOCX file
3. File is uploaded to their Google Drive
4. File is automatically converted to Google Docs format
5. Text is extracted from the Google Doc
6. Resume is processed with LLM
7. Google Doc URL is stored in profile
8. User can preview and edit the Google Doc directly
9. Resume can now be tailored using the existing tailoring functionality

BENEFITS:
---------
✅ PDF preview now works (Google Docs are easily embeddable)
✅ Users can edit their resume directly in Google Docs
✅ Resume tailoring works seamlessly (already designed for Google Docs)
✅ Better OCR and text extraction from Google's conversion
✅ Consistent workflow - everything uses Google Docs now
✅ No local file storage needed on the server

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
⚠️ Users MUST connect their Google account before uploading files
⚠️ Users need Google Drive permission (already included in OAuth scopes)

To test:
1. Go to Profile page
2. Connect Google account if not already connected
3. Switch to "Upload File" tab in Resume Upload section
4. Select a PDF or DOCX file
