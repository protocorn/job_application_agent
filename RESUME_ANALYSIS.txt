PDF TO GOOGLE DOC CONVERSION - IMPLEMENTED
===========================================

PROBLEMS ADDRESSED:
-------------------
1. Users were unable to preview PDF files uploaded via the file upload feature
   - Error: "Failed to launch 'uploaded:filename.pdf' because the scheme does not have a registered handler"
   - The uploaded PDF was stored with a fake URL "uploaded:filename" which couldn't be previewed

2. Users didn't understand why they needed to connect their Google account

3. Resume section had intimidating animations and was too large

SOLUTIONS:
----------
1. PDFs and DOCX files are now automatically uploaded to Google Drive and converted to Google Docs format
2. Added clear explanations for why Google account connection is required
3. Made the resume section more compact and removed distracting animations

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. BACKEND (server/api_server.py):
   - Modified the `/api/upload-resume` endpoint to:
     * Require Google OAuth connection (users must connect Google account first)
     * Upload the PDF/DOCX file to user's Google Drive
     * Automatically convert to Google Docs format using Drive API
     * Extract text from the Google Doc (not the original PDF)
     * Process with LLM and return the Google Doc URL
     * Store the Google Doc URL in the user's profile

2. FRONTEND (Website/job-agent-frontend/src/Profile.js):
   - Updated the `processResumeFile` function to:
     * Use the Google Doc URL returned from backend (instead of "uploaded:filename")
     * Update resumeUrl state for preview
     * Show preview of the Google Doc automatically
     * Handle errors when Google account is not connected
   
   - Updated UI to:
     * Disable upload button if Google account is not connected
     * Show warning message requiring Google account connection
     * Change button text to "Upload & Convert to Google Doc"
     * Display helpful info about the conversion process
     * Added clear explanations for why Google account is needed with 4 key benefits:
       - Resume Management (PDF/DOCX conversion to Google Docs)
       - Direct Editing (edit anytime without re-uploading)
       - AI Tailoring (required for resume customization)
       - Privacy (only access explicitly shared documents)

3. FRONTEND STYLING (Website/job-agent-frontend/src/Profile.css):
   - Removed animations:
     * Removed pulse animation on processing button (was too distracting)
     * Removed scaleIn animation on success icon (was intimidating)
   - Made sections more compact:
     * Reduced padding on all resume-related sections (32px → 20px)
     * Reduced gaps between elements (20px → 12px)
     * Reduced icon sizes (64px → 48px)
     * Reduced heading sizes (1.8rem → 1.3rem)
     * Reduced iframe height (700px → 600px)
     * Made buttons smaller and less prominent

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
-----------------
1. User connects their Google account (required)
2. User selects a PDF or DOCX file
3. File is uploaded to their Google Drive
4. File is automatically converted to Google Docs format
5. Text is extracted from the Google Doc
6. Resume is processed with LLM
7. Google Doc URL is stored in profile
