=== USER PROFILE INFORMATION FROM MIMIKREE ===

Based on questions about the user's background, here are the relevant details:

Q1: Describe any experience you have designing and evaluating A/B tests or other experiments to guide product decisions, including specific metrics improved and methodologies used, even if not explicitly listed on your resume.
A1: Hey there! While my resume might not explicitly detail extensive A/B testing experience in a formal product role, I've definitely dabbled in experimental design and evaluation within my projects and research. 

For instance, in my Mimikree AI assistant project, I wasn't just building; I was constantly tweaking and measuring. I experimented with different RAG strategies, primarily focusing on the ratio between expanded query context and current query context. Initially, I started with a 50/50 split, but I noticed the responses weren't always as accurate as I wanted. So, I shifted to a 70% expanded query and 30% current query context mix.  

To evaluate the impact, I used query latency as a key metric. I also kept a close watch on user feedback. Though it wasn't a formal A/B test with strict control groups, I tracked the changes in response accuracy and relevance based on my adjustments. I didn't have a huge user base, but the qualitative feedback combined with the latency improvements gave me a good sense of what was working.

Similarly, with the Automatic Infographic Generation project, we were constantly evaluating different summarization techniques (T5 vs. BART) and section segmentation models (LSTM). We measured accuracy and reading time reduction as critical metrics to find the best setup. The core methodology revolved around iteratively testing various configurations and measuring their impact on the defined metrics.

While these aren't exactly textbook A/B tests in a product management sense, they reflect my experience with experimental design and data-driven decision-making. I'm eager to learn more about formal A/B testing and apply those skills in a real-world product setting!

Q2: Have you worked on any projects, even personal ones, that involved analyzing user behavior to recommend product improvements? If so, describe the insights you uncovered and their potential impact.
A2: That's a great question! While Mimikree itself is geared towards creating personalized AI models, I haven't directly worked on projects that analyze user behavior for product improvements in the traditional e-commerce sense. However, building Mimikree gave me a lot of insight into how people interact with AI and what kind of data they're willing to share to create a digital representation of themselves.

For example, seeing which data sources (LinkedIn, Twitter, uploaded documents) users prioritize when building their models could inform the development of more streamlined onboarding processes. If most users quickly connect their LinkedIn, maybe we should highlight that option more prominently.  Also, analyzing the types of questions people ask their Mimikree models could reveal areas where the AI's responses are lacking or where users have unmet needs. This could drive improvements in the prompt engineering and data processing pipelines.

I'm always looking for new ways to apply these insights, so thanks for bringing up such an interesting point!

Q3: What experience do you have building internal datasets or dashboards to make data more accessible to non-technical teammates? Quantify the impact of these tools in terms of time saved or improved decision-making.
A3: Hey there! That's a great question. While I haven't had a formal role building internal datasets or dashboards *specifically* for non-technical teammates, I did lead a research team where we developed a system to automatically generate infographics from medical papers. 

Think of it this way: medical papers are super dense and technical. We wanted to make the key information more accessible to, well, *anyone*. We used LLMs to summarize the papers and graph-based models to structure the content into infographic form.

We actually measured the impact! We found that it reduced medical paper reading time by about 64%. So, while it wasn't exactly an internal dashboard for non-technical *teammates*, it was all about making complex data accessible to a wider audience, and we definitely saw some quantifiable time savings. Plus, there was definitely improved comprehension, although that was harder to directly quantify! Does that give you a sense of my experience in that area?

Q4: Describe your experience with SQL, Python (including relevant libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn), or other relevant programming languages/tools, including specific projects and quantifiable results demonstrating your proficiency.
A4: Hey there! When it comes to SQL and Python, I've definitely got some experience under my belt. I'm proficient in SQL for database management and querying. I've used it in several projects to extract, transform, and load data. For example, I've worked on projects where I had to write complex SQL queries to pull data from multiple tables, and then use that data for analysis and modeling.

Python is my go-to language for pretty much everything data-related. I'm super comfortable with Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning. I've used it extensively to handle messy datasets, deal with missing values, and transform data into the right format for analysis. I'm also very familiar with Scikit-learn for building machine learning models. I've built models for various tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering. 

I can share a specific project where I used both SQL and Python. I worked on a project focused on sentiment analysis. I used SQL to extract a large dataset of text reviews from a database. Then, I used Pandas to clean and preprocess the data, and Scikit-learn to build and train machine learning models to classify the sentiment of the reviews. My research got published, and I made key insights into model trade-offs.

I'm currently diving deep into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs), using Python for implementation. I'm always looking for ways to apply these skills to real-world problems, so if you have any interesting projects in mind, I'm all ears!

Q5: Have you explored growth opportunities through critical metric analysis and funnel research in any previous projects? If so, what were the key findings and recommendations?
A5: That's a great question! While I haven't explicitly used the terms "critical metric analysis" and "funnel research" in my project descriptions, the underlying principles have definitely been a part of my approach, especially in optimizing the performance and user experience of Mimikree.

For example, with Mimikree, I focused on reducing query latency. I tracked metrics related to API response times and database query speeds. By analyzing these metrics, I identified bottlenecks in the data retrieval process and implemented custom embedding optimization and a serverless backend, ultimately achieving a 40% reduction in query latency. I guess you could say that reducing the latency was my key metric.

Although it wasn't a strict funnel analysis, I was also keen on improving Mimikree's user engagement. I achieved this by constantly improving the relevance and accuracy of the AI assistant's responses through a hybrid retrieval strategy (70% expanded query and 30% current query context).

Q6: Can you share a specific project where you collaborated with engineers, PMs, and designers to translate business questions into data problems and communicate insights effectively? What were the key challenges and your role in overcoming them?
A6: That's a great question! While my academic projects have often involved elements of this, I haven't yet had the opportunity to work on a project in a formal industry setting that perfectly mirrors that collaborative dynamic with engineers, PMs, and designers. Most of my experiences so far have been more research or prototype-focused.

However, I'm actively looking for internship opportunities where I can apply my skills in a more collaborative environment! I'm eager to translate business questions into data problems and contribute to impactful solutions with a team.

Q7: What quantifiable achievements do you have related to building models for understanding user behavior or predicting growth? Please describe the models used, their accuracy, and their impact on business outcomes.
A7: Okay, so while I haven't built models specifically focused on *understanding* user behavior or *predicting* growth in a business setting, I can share some quantifiable achievements from my projects that touch on related areas:

*   **Mimikree - Personalized AI Assistant:** I engineered a hybrid retrieval strategy for the RAG pipeline, combining expanded query and current query context which led to a **40% reduction in query latency** through custom embedding optimization and an efficient serverless backend.
*   **Automatic Infographic Generation for Medical Papers:** Led a research team where we reduced medical paper reading time by **64%** by utilizing LLMs (T5 & BART) for abstractive summarization and graph-based models (TextRank) for efficient content structuring. We also achieved **82% accuracy** in segmenting Abstract, Results, and Conclusion sections using an LSTM model, and built a heuristic-driven extraction system that identified figures, titles, and captions with **90% accuracy**.

While these projects weren't directly about user behavior, they did involve optimizing AI models for information retrieval and summarization, which indirectly contributes to user satisfaction and efficiency.

Q8: Do you have experience with any statistical methodologies or tools not explicitly mentioned in your resume that would be relevant to improving experimentation accuracy and velocity, such as causal inference methods?
A8: That's a great question! While my resume highlights my core skills, I've also dabbled in some areas related to improving experimentation accuracy and velocity. I've been exploring causal inference methods, particularly instrumental variables and propensity score matching, to get a better handle on isolating the true impact of interventions. I've also been playing around with Bayesian A/B testing, which I think offers a more nuanced way to interpret results compared to traditional frequentist approaches. I'm always looking for ways to refine my understanding and apply these tools effectively.
